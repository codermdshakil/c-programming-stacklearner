/**
 * Mainly three types of operators
 * 1. Unary
 * 2. Binary
 * 3. Ternary
 * 
 * 1. Unary Operators: Unary operators have one operand.
 * 
 * What is oparand?
 * => a + b here + is Operator and a, b operand.
 * 
 * 2. Binary Operators : Binary operators have two operand. There are different types of binary operators
 * 
 * - Arithmetic (+, -, * , /, %)
 * - Relational (>,<, >=, <= , ==, !=)
 * - Logical (&&, ||, !)
 * - Assignment (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
 * - Bitwise (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
 * 
 * 3. Ternary Operators : Ternary Operators have three operand. Ex- Conditional Operators
